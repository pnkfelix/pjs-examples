    <title>Parallel Javascript Demos</title>
  </head>
  <body>
This is a collection of ParallelArray demos.

The initial set of three have been ported directly from
the [original RiverTrail examples](https://github.com/RiverTrail/RiverTrail).

(The history of this `pjs-examples` repository was generated by
`git filter-branch`'ing the history of the `RiverTrail` repository.)

These examples have been revised to work with the new ParallelArray
code that is under development, see the
[iontrail repository](https://github.com/syg/iontrail) on github.
