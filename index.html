    <title>Parallel Javascript Demos</title>
  </head>
  <body>
This is a collection of ParallelArray demos.</p>

<p>The initial set of three have been ported directly from
the <a href="https://github.com/RiverTrail/RiverTrail">original RiverTrail examples</a>.</p>

<p>(The history of this <code>pjs-examples</code> repository was generated by
<code>git filter-branch</code>'ing the history of the <code>RiverTrail</code> repository.)</p>

<p>These examples have been revised to work with the new ParallelArray
code that is under development, see the
<a href="https://github.com/syg/iontrail">iontrail repository</a> on github.</p>
